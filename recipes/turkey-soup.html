    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade turkey soup is a nourishing, full-flavoured way to make the most of your Thanksgiving leftovers. Starting with the turkey carcass, the bones are simmered slowly with water, onions, garlic, and seasonings to create a rich, savoury bone broth that’s packed with depth and nutrition. This slow process extracts the natural flavours and gelatin from the bones, forming a golden, hearty base that sets this soup apart from store-bought versions.</p>
    <p>Once the broth is strained, it’s loaded with bite-sized pieces of leftover turkey, chopped celery, carrots, onion, and your choice of rice or noodles for a complete, satisfying meal. Lightly seasoned with poultry herbs and a dash of salt and pepper, this soup brings warmth and comfort in every spoonful. It’s an easy, budget-friendly recipe that turns scraps into something soul-soothing—perfect for chilly evenings and an ideal way to reduce waste while making something delicious from scratch.</p>
