    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Taco casserole is a layered dish that combines the flavours of a taco in a convenient, baked casserole format. 
    it typically features seasoned ground beef, tortillas, re-fried beans, corn, salsa, and cheese. Optional additions such as beans,
    black olives, sour cream, and various other toppings. The layers are similar to a taco or even a Tex-Mex lasagna. Also known as a taco salad casserole.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook ground beef, onion, and green bell pepper in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until meat is browned and vegetables are tender, 8 minutes; drain fat.</li>
        <li>Stir corn, water, and taco seasoning mix into the skillet. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat refried beans in a small bowl in the microwave until softened, 1 to 3 minutes, stirring once. Add 1/3 cup salas</li>
        <li>Place tortilla chips in the prepared baking dish and coarsely smash with your hands. Spoon refried beans over the chips and spread in an even layer. Top with ground beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top with cheese. Bake until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top individual servings with romaine and tomato. Drizzle with sour cream, and salsa. Serve with additional tortilla chips.</li>
