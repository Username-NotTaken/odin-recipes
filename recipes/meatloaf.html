    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hearty meatloaf is a comforting, classic dinner with a flavourful twist. Made from a blend of ground beef, breadcrumbs, sautéed onions, and savoury seasonings, it’s shaped into a tender loaf and baked to perfection. What sets this version apart is the rich, tangy topping: a modified ketchup glaze made by blending ketchup with a hint of brown sugar, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and a touch of smoked paprika. This sauce caramelizes beautifully in the oven, adding a sweet and smoky depth that complements the juicy meatloaf beneath.</p>
    <p>Perfect for a family dinner or leftovers the next day, this meatloaf balances traditional comfort with bold flavour. Serve it alongside mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a fresh salad to round out the meal. Whether you're learning to cook or building your first recipe site, this dish is a simple, reliable staple worth sharing.</p>
